# Additional Feature Suggestions

## 1. Saved filter presets
Allow users to save commonly used filter combinations on the product list (e.g., category + price + tags) and reapply them with one click. Persist the presets per account or per browser, and surface them near the search bar. Include a shareable link for each preset to complement the existing URL-sync behavior.

## 2. Compare drawer for products
Enable selecting multiple products from the list and open a comparison drawer/table showing specs, price range, and key differentiators side by side. Integrate with the product detail data model so spec updates propagate to comparison results, and support exporting the comparison as a PDF.

## 3. Inquiry history with CRM handoff
Add a personal "My Inquiries" section where users can review submitted LeadForm entries, their status (received / contacted / closed), and follow-up notes. Provide an admin export and optional webhook/CRM integration so sales teams can sync leads automatically.

## 4. Smart recommendations on detail page
Show recommended products based on viewed item's category, attributes, and user behavior (recent searches, favorites). Provide an inline carousel and a "similar items" section, with the recommendations updated when filters change.

## 5. Multi-channel contact widgets
Offer persistent floating contact widgets (phone, WhatsApp/WeChat, email) with configurable business hours. Outside business hours, route users to schedule a callback or leave a message via LeadForm with auto-tagged source/channel.

## 6. Content-rich FAQs and guides
Attach contextual FAQs and how-to guides to product categories and the contact page. Support rich content (images/video), search within FAQs, and link to relevant products or LeadForm prefilled topics.

## 7. Audit and analytics dashboard
Provide an internal dashboard for tracking product views, filter usage, lead submissions, and contact channel conversions. Include funnel visualization and anomaly alerts (e.g., sudden drop in leads) to help optimize marketing efforts.
